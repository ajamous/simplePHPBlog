# simplePHPBlog

An extreamly simple PHP Blog Application for those who need just the starting point. At the moment you can insert records from database only (PHPMYADMIN) and it wll be displayed on the front end nicley using bootstrap styling.

I plan to update it to include some forms that will interact with inserting records to the database from the web app it self. feel free to fork this applicaiton or create Pull Requests
